## **Feature Request Guidelines**
*Before submitting, please:*
1. Check if a similar issue exists
2. Ensure the feature aligns with Substrate X theory
3. Consider the mathematical implications (β, γ, tension dynamics)

---

## **Feature Description**
*A clear description of what you want to happen:*

## **Mathematical Justification**
*How does this feature relate to T = α|∇ρ| + βE - γF?*
- Does it affect α (spatial gradient)?
- Does it modify β (excitation sensitivity)?  
- Does it influence γ (damping coefficient)?
- Does it create new tension domains?

## **Gameplay Impact**
*How would this change Minecraft gameplay?*
- New tension sources? (E changes)
- New damping mechanisms? (F changes)
- New visualization methods?
- New player interactions?

## **Implementation Considerations**
*Technical thoughts (optional):*
- Performance impact?
- Multiplayer compatibility?
- Configuration needs?
- Integration with other mods?

## **Priority Level**
- [ ] **Critical** (core system enhancement)
- [ ] **Important** (major gameplay addition)
- [ ] **Nice-to-have** (quality of life)
- [ ] **Experimental** (theory testing)

## **Domain Category**
- [ ] **Horror** (creates fear/dread tension)
- [ ] **Economic** (affects resource tension)
- [ ] **Survival** (impacts survival tension)
- [ ] **Social** (affects villager/player tension)
- [ ] **Environmental** (changes world tension)
- [ ] **Cross-domain** (affects multiple domains)

## **Additional Context**
